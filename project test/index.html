        <p>The Travel Channel called our classic wooden boardwalk America's best. National Geographic named it one of the top 10 in the U.S. And USA Today named it one of the nation's best boardwalks for food. In short, it's three miles of highly concentrated fun - and one more reason to vacation in OCMD.

Day or night, there's always something happening - and quite often, it's free.

Amusements and arcades are fun for children of all ages. Catch a spectacular view from the tops of one of our ferris wheels. Scream with delight on our roller coaster or savor the slower pace of our magnificent 1902 carousel. Oh, and don't forget to stop by one of our many arcades and play to win!

Hungry? You won't be for long. Choose from famous Maryland crab cakes or delightful Delmarva fried chicken. Tear into a delicious cheeseburger or savor a smoky pit beef. Enjoy fresh-baked pizza or our famous french fries - with Ocean City dining, the menu is almost endless.

And that's before you get to dessert. There's luscious saltwater taffy, sweet caramel popcorn, thick creamy fudge, rich ice cream, fresh, hot funnel cakes, cotton candy and chocolate-covered strawberries.

After a boardwalk meal, you'll be ready to shop - and you'll find plenty of opportunities, along the boardwalk and on many side streets as well.
